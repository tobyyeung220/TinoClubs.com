    "adjustment_policy": "If officers can no longer serve their position for their club or consistently fail to fulfill their officer responsibilities, they will either be replaced by a new officer or existing officer. If an existing officer is able to take up their responsibilities, their role will be changed to accommodate for the responsibilities of their old position and the position that needs to be filled. If an existing officer cannot take up the responsibilities of the open role, an application will be created for finding a new officer. This application process will be very similar to how officers are selected for the following year.",
    "new_officer_application": "Towards the second half of the second semester of the school year, the current President will appoint a junior or sophomore who is currently on the officer team as President for the following school year. The current President will also create an application using google forms. The application will ask for the applicant's interest in the club and in photography. The application will also ask officers to submit some of their photography work. There will also be questions that are role-specific that will ask why the applicant is fit for the specific role they are applying for. Other than the application form, other criteria for selecting officers will include the applicant's commitment to and attendance with the club as a regular member."
