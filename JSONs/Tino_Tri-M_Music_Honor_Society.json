    "adjustment_policy": "If an officer fails to fulfill their responsibilities or is otherwise unable to serve, existing officers will split the added responsibilities until a new officer is selected. New responsibilities will be distributed based on the previous experience of the officers as well as the type of responsibility involved (financial, administrative, outreach, etc.)",
    "new_officer_application": "New officers will be selected in a two-step process. First, applicants will submit a google form describing their previous experience, the reason for applying, and their interest in the club. If applicants demonstrate that they are capable of serving the club and have a genuine interest in the club, they will move on to the second round. Here, interviews will be held to decide between applicants accepted in the initial round."
