    "adjustment_policy": "WEA will be continuing a policy implemented during the previous school year, the policy entails that three officer strikes result in being removed from the officer team. Not completing a task on time twice, without communicating with the executive team first, will result in an officer strike. If this occurs one more time after the first strike, it will result in an additional strike. Extensions can be granted but communication is key. However, any strikes at all will reflect poorly when performance evaluations are conducted at the end of the year to decide any new position, since positions are not guaranteed for the following year. In the instance that an officer is removed, | will follow the same protocol as last year, when one of the PR officers chose to leave the officer team during first semester. | would open an application for that position as soon as possible, while following our standard two-step process.",
    "new_officer_application": "New officers will be selected through a two-step application process. First, the President and VP will review the written application that is submitted via Google Form. After the applications have been thoroughly evaluated, cuts will be made, and the President & VP will conduct interviews with the remaining candidates. The final decision will be made collaboratively between the President and VP, taking into consideration the candidates\u2019 written application, interview, and meeting attendance throughout the year."
